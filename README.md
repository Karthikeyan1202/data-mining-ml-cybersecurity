**Notes**:  
- **Kaggle** was primarily used for sourcing datasets (e.g., SQLi & XSS dataset, Android Malware dataset).  
- Experiments were implemented in **Python** using ML/DL frameworks such as **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, and **Keras**.  
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** were used for dataset preprocessing and feature handling.  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** were used for visualizing results (accuracy, loss curves, confusion matrices).  
- Work was carried out in **Jupyter Notebook** and **Kaggle Notebooks**.
